  brief: A Linux sysad turned developer, I excel at finding and applying best
    practices to everything I do professionally, even if it takes a couple tries
    to get it working, then get it right, and apply those lessons learned in the
    future. With experience in multiple languages and systems, I am adept at
    learning new methodologies and keeping the basics in mind.
